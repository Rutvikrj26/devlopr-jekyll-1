  four years of his Bachelor's degree.

Mechanical Engineering is a very vast field in the sense that it covers, Designing, Manufacturing, and Maintenance of almost all the physical products visible to us. It ranges from ancient art such as carpentry and blacksmith to modern additive manufacturing technologies. Manufacturing is but only one side of Mechanical Engineering. Design is the other side of the coin. All the subdomains of Engineering such as Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, etc are highly linked to each other and very often, an improvement in one demands an improvement in others.

The Initial two years of a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering go into discovering several topics ranging from solid and Fluid Mechanics to Dynamics of motion. These topics try to give a basic understanding of all the possible streams that a student can choose to specialize in. After gaining the basics of all the topics, students get a chance to explore the interest of his topics by choosing several higher-level courses in his field. 

The topics discussed in the first two years are the topics established in the field very early. The third and fourth year of the Mechanical Engineering focuses on fairly advanced topics that are discovered in recent history. these topics include Design Principles, Operations management, Control theory, etc. These topics provide relevant skills to the student in the current industrial scenario. These are still just the tip of the iceberg but, these courses make the base platform that helps you build further knowledge on it, 

You are then expected to put these courses to use in your Final B.Tech Project and produce some good quality products or gain good research experience.

This was a short snapshot of what academic study you get in Mechanical Engineering.

Adios, Amigo.
