A furnace consists of a converging draft chamber. There are 4 layers in boundary. Most outer
part of furnace is of Iron which helps to furnace to remain in their shape because when the
furnace is heated due to expansion the inner layer of boundary try to expand. Inside this Iron
layer there is a layer of Alumina wool blanket which is used as insulation. So that heat loss
through the boundary is minimum. Inside this layer, there is a layer of clay and inside that layer, there
is insulation at inner side of furnace. The furnace consists of 1 primary opening and 16
secondary opening.

The Primary opening is used to feed fuel and the secondary openings are used to feed glass to be
melted. The flue gases released during combustion travel through the converging furnace
driven by the natural draft of air coming through the opening. The air along with flue gases
enters into the chimney and flue gases come of the chimney into the ambient air.
