Biodiesel is a renewable alternate source of petroleum and can be used in the engine. It is Eco-friendly, non-toxic and it is thought to be future diesel. Petroleum is a natural source that is rapidly depleted. Bio-fuel is obtained from vegetable oil, algae, edible and non-edible beans. It is derived from triglycerides and fatty acids by trans-esterification and esterification, respectively. As we all know that fossil fuels are limited resources, we heavily depend on petroleum for transportation, industries, and agricultural machinery. Industrialization, urbanization, and increasing population are increasing demand for energy. To satisfy our increasing energy requirements consumption of fossil fuel which are limited. In cities, air contamination increases because the diesel engine is a big pollution source by traffic in urban areas. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are rapidly increases and many other gasses from smoke release. so pressure on researchers to search alternate ways of diesel to reduce environmental pollution. In diesel engine emissions, using mineral diesel, the presence of sulphur & results in sulphur oxides and sulfates. When these sulfur chemicals are released into the atmosphere they form sulfur dioxide which combines with water to form sulfuric acid. This acid is carried by winds to neighboring regions, dropping onto the land when it rains. This phenomenon is known as acid rain. The finite nature of fossil fuels necessitates the consideration of alternative fuels from renewable sources. Bio-Diesel is an alternative to liquid fossil fuels prevalent in society.

This is an excellent sustainable resource of Energy and can be produced from oils. Here
using non-edible oils and producing Bio-diesel actually puts us in a cycle where we produce
CO2 by burning Bio-Diesel and at the same time, we need to grow trees for producing
oils(edible/non-edible).Bio-diesel is free from sulphur (as it is derived from vegetable oils) and its use substantially reduces the emissions of SO2 and aromatics as well. Even on blending with mineral diesel, bio-diesel significantly reduces emissions.

Currently, there are various options for sustainable energy sources but developing them
would require a setup of totally new technology and infrastructure which would cost high
and at the same time would not be of any help to Developing Nations. They still have
areas that arenâ€™t even electrified, so bringing new technology in rural areas is practically impossible. But what if we did not have to change the whole of the infrastructure and just by
changing the source of energy, we could make the power cheaper and sustainable along with
it being Eco-friendly. That would be a win-win situation and very beneficial.
Most of our current diesel engines can be used with a very minor change in engines. It has better quality exhaust gas emission since the organic carbon present in it is photosynthetic in origin. It does not contribute to increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and consequently to the greenhouse effect. In spite of higher emission level of NOx, the emission from bio-diesel combustion contained lower amounts of CO, CO2, HC and smoke.
